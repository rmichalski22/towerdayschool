            <h2>Kindergarten Program</h2>
            
            <p>The Tower Day School Kindergarten Class is a full day program. The class meets on Mondays from 8:30-noon, and then Tuesdays-Fridays from 8:30-2:30. Monday afternoons are used for parent conferences and individual tutoring. Extended day is available in our pre-school for students who need to stay on Monday afternoons. The maximum enrollment is 15 children with a teacher and a teacher assistant.</p>

                <h3>Curriculum Highlights</h3>
                <p>The curriculum is rich in both academic and creative opportunities:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Letter recognition and sound/symbol relationships</li>
                    <li>Math, science, and social studies activities</li>
                    <li>Writing activities integrated throughout the week</li>

                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Assessment and Individualized Learning</h3>
            <p>The week before school officially starts each child is informally tested by the teacher. Then after the teacher has worked with the students for a few weeks, she writes an individual assessment and program plan for each child. Goals are changed as needed. Parent conferences are held every two months.</p>

            <h3>Enrollment Information</h3>
            <p>Priority for enrollment is given to Tower Day School students. Students from outside the school should present a letter from a preschool that indicates the child's readiness for kindergarten. All families should have their child attend the kindergarten screenings at their local public schools. Please call the Tower Day School office (<a href="tel:7813345576">781-334-5576</a>) to schedule an appointment to visit the class.</p>
