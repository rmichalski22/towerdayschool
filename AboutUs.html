                <p><em>"Early childhood is a critical time in the development of vocabulary and other skills. These skills provide the foundation for learning to read and write and for later academic achievement."</em></p>

            <p>Our teachers provide opportunities for children to explore materials, engage in physical activities, and to interact with peers and adults. A balance of child-initiated and teacher selected activities are part of the daily routine. The teachers are aware of children's individual interests and strengths and find ways to engage and expand them. They arrange for a rich variety of learning experiences that alternate individual, partnered, small group and large group activities.</p>

            <p>We combine structured learning activities with free play, allowing children to learn through exploration and discovery. Our curriculum is designed to develop:</p>
