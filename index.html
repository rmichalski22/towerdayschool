                    <h3>2.9 & 3 Year Olds</h3>
                    <p>The focus of our 2.9 and 3 year old classrooms is definitely social emotional development. Using various learning areas, the teachers spend time helping the children play together, learn to share, use their words, begin to take responsibility for their personal objects, and become comfortable being away from home. In general, they are socialized to "life in a classroom".</p>

                <div class="program-card">
                    <h3>4 Year Olds</h3>
                    <p>Although social emotional development is a factor throughout early childhood, our four year old classes also have an eye on the educational skills necessary for literacy and other academic development. There are many language activities at Tower Day School. Children are exposed to new vocabulary, descriptive words, re-telling of events and other activities to increase their oral language skills.</p>

        <!-- Learning Approach -->
        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Our Learning Approach</h2>
            <p>Each day we provide a richness and variety of activities and experiences in a flexible and pleasant atmosphere that introduces the children at Tower Day School to the exciting world of nature, art, science, math, social studies, language and music. We want each child to find school a happy place where he/she will derive satisfaction from inventing, creating, discovering, practicing skills, taking responsibility as well as meeting and solving problems in the presence of sensitive teaching. We consider the total child and provide experiences to encourage physical (gross and fine motor), social, emotional, and intellectual development.</p>
            
            <h3>Class Sizes</h3>
            <p>In order to maximize individual attention, our preschool class size is capped at 12 children per class with a teacher and a teacher assistant, or in most cases, two teachers.</p>
            
            <h3>Academic Development</h3>
            <p>Our students use every math operation that adults use. They do simple addition and subtraction, make graphs, estimate, predict, form sets, etc. Needless to say, these are all completed in a very hands on manner.</p>
